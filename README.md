# 🔧 The Toolbox (a.k.a. /dev/chaos)

> "Works on my machine." - Unknown

## Manifesto
This isn't a polished library. This isn't a startup product. This is a feral collection of scripts, automations, and digital crowbars that have accumulated over time.

Some of it is elegant; some of it is pure spaghetti code born at 3 AM to solve a very specific problem that shouldn't have existed in the first place. It’s unrefined, pragmatic, and it does exactly what it says on the tin.

## Contents
An eclectic mix of Python, Bash, and whatever tool happened to be within reach. Expect to find:
* **Data munging scripts** that force file formats to be friends against their will.
* **System utilities** I was too lazy to type out manually every time.
* **Automations** for tasks that were slowly stealing my will to live.

## Usage & Warning
Use at your own risk. I take no responsibility for exploded servers, lost data, or existential dread caused by reading the source code.

**Pro-Tip:**
Read the code before you run it. Always. Do not blindly slap `sudo` in front of this stuff.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/thekryz/script_collection.git](https://github.com/thekryz/script_collection.git)
cd script_collection
chmod +x that_sketchy_script.sh
./that_sketchy_script.sh --force
